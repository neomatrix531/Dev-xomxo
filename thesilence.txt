Hear the void.
Core Hook
Players discover corrupted Roblox games and profiles, each hinting at a gradual erasure of existence. The initial entry point is a seemingly normal but subtly altered game, where inconsistencies and glitches lead to the discovery of hidden messages. These messages reveal a looming threat: the silencing of memories and identities within the digital world of Forsaken, slowly bleeding into reality.

Incorporated Themes
The core theme is the gradual loss of self and reality within a persistent online environment. Surrealism is woven through distorted imagery, dream logic puzzles, and unsettling sound design. The ARG explores anxieties about digital identity, memory, and the potential for virtual spaces to affect the real world. The 'Forsaken' custom universe allows for a unique blend of familiar Roblox elements with a dark, existential narrative.
Universe-Specific Flavor
Forsaken is a corrupted version of Roblox where digital identities are tied to real-world memories. In-game avatars are not just representations, but vessels containing fractured pieces of a person's experiences. The 'silence' manifests as the deletion of these memories, causing corresponding changes in the real world – forgotten details, altered relationships, and a growing sense of unease. Roblox's building mechanics are twisted into puzzle elements, exploiting the platform's familiar tools for unsettling purposes. 'Robux' can even become a meta-resource that needs to be strategically sacrificed.
Puzzle Structure
Early Phase: Discovering glitched games, deciphering hidden messages within Roblox builds and avatar descriptions, uncovering the JX1DX1 account.
Mid Phase: Solving audio puzzles embedded in distorted in-game soundtracks, manipulating game scripts to reveal secret areas, collaborative memory reconstruction using fragmented game data.
Late Phase: Real-world tasks involving location-based puzzles connected to in-game landmarks (photographs needing to be taken, specific objects needing to be found that are referenced in game), confronting JX1DX1 (either through a collaborative in-game event or a more involved real-world task related to the game's narrative).
Twist / Meta Layer
The JX1DX1 account isn't controlled by a single person, but rather is an emergent entity, formed from aggregated abandoned Roblox accounts and discarded memories within the Forsaken universe. Furthermore, the 'silence' isn't just a digital phenomenon – it's affecting the real life humans themselves. As they progress, players begin to experience minor memory lapses and distortions in their own lives, blurring the lines between the game and reality. The final puzzle requires players to confront these personal 'silences', sharing their experiences to break the entity's influence.
we are forsaken!!!!!!111!1!1!1!!1!
